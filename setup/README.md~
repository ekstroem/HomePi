# Setup for new raspberry pi

(This works at least with the new Raspberry Pi 2)

## Running for the first time

1. Change the default user password from the blue screen (alternatively run `raspi-config` to get it started). The default password is `raspberry`.
2. Change if you want to boot into desktop or command line
3. Change localizations
4. Set overclocking (usually running `medium`)
5. Under advanced options change hostname and enable ssh. Change the memory split if not running a graphical interface. Update the tool

## Update packages in termindal

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```
