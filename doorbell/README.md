# General idea

* Use a 433 MHz transmitter to send a wireless signal to the RPi when the door bell button is pushed
* Use the RPi to make a tweet notification

My current door bell is a wireless one that already uses a 433 MHz
signal so there is no need to rig up a transmitter. I just need to
capture the signal that it sends out.

A lot of the information here was copied verbatim from 
[this page](http://www.princetronics.com/how-to-read-433-mhz-codes-w-raspberry-pi-433-mhz-receiver/)
or from [this YouTube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJVyMYJ1XQ).

## Requirements

* Raspberry Pi
* A 433 MHz receiver
* A wireless door bell. I used this one ![alt text](https://github.com/ekstroem/HomePi/master/doorbell/images/bell.jpg  "My door bell")
* Two resistors 18k Ohm and 33k Ohm


## Hardware installation


As you can see in the picture, my 433 MHz receiver actually has two
Data-pins. Why it has two pins I donâ€™t exactly know, but a possibility
is it is used to easily connect two output-sources, or two different
Arduinos. In this project however we will only need to use one of the
pins. I used the one closest to the GND-pin.


I'm not entirely strong on electronics but it seems to me from reading
various blogs and webpages that a
[voltage divider](http://elinux.org/RPi_GPIO_Interface_Circuits) is a
good idea to reduce the voltage from 5 V to 3.3 V. The Raspberry Pi
provides 5V but the GPIO should only have 3.3 V as input. The
construction is seen in the link above and the two resistors needed
are

| 18k | 33k |
|---|---|
| Brown   | Orange |
| Gray    | Orange |
| Orange  | Orange |
| Gold    | Gold   |




## Immediate to do

* Use the wiring/arduino modules This means that I should
    * check the voltage on our regular door bell.
    * Hook up the transmitter module so that it sends a signal when the button is pushed
    * Check that it works with the arduino
    * Rig up the receiver module to workd with the GPIO on the RPi.
    * Code the software

## Software - part 1

WiringPi is a library used to control GPIO in C and much more. It is
installed with the following commands

```
git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
cd wiringPi
./build
```
The installation produces the following note
```
NOTE: To compile programs with wiringPi, you need to add:
-lwiringPi
to your compile line(s) To use the Gertboard, MaxDetect, etc.
code (the devLib), you need to also add:
-lwiringPiDev
to your compile line(s).
```


In addition we need the following library to interface with the
receiver. This library uses the wiringPi lib from above so we need to
compile that first.

```
git clone git://github.com/ninjablocks/433Utils.git
cd 433Utils/RPi_utils
make
```


## Potential problems?

* Will the be too much triggering noise from other products on the
  receiver end?
