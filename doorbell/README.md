## General idea


* Use a 433MHz transmitter to send a wireless signal to the raspberry when the normal (wired) door bell button is pushed
* Use the RPi to make a notification

## So far

* Nothing. Still on the drawing board

## Immediate to do

* Use the wiring/arduino modules [seen in this YouTube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHJVyMYJ1XQ). This means that I should
    * check the coltage on our regular door bell.
    * Hook up the transmitter module so that it sends a signal when the button is pushed
    * Check that it works with the arduino
    * Rig up the receiver module to workd with the GPIO on the RPi.
    * Code the software


## Potential problems

* Will the be too much triggering noise from other products on the
  receiver end?
