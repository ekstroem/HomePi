# Backup of SD card

There are two obvious options to create a backup of an RPi SD card:

1. Use `dd` to make an identical image
2. Use `rsync` to make a traditional backup

## Using `dd`

Using `dd` is best when you have a completely separate partition that
you car write to, write speed is not a problem, and when you want to
make a copy that is a complete clone of the original image.

## Using `rsync`

```
#!/bin/bash
# script to synchronise Pi files to backup
BACKUP_MOUNTED=$(mount | awk '/PiData/ {print $6}' | grep "rw")
if [ $BACKUP_MOUNTED ]; then
    echo $BACKUP_MOUNTED
    echo "Commencing Backup"
    rsync -avH --delete-during --delete-excluded
	--exclude-from=/usr/bin/rsync-exclude.txt / /mnt/PiData/PiBackup/
else
	echo "Backup drive not available or not writable"
	fi
```
